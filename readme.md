# Welcome to Assignment&nbsp;2 Part&nbsp;1 ##

This is document version 1, dated 2024-01-23.

1.  You can and may personalize the styling of this document and any of
    the markdown documents provided with this assignment by editing the
    `<STYLE>` section at the end of a particular document. In `IntelliJ`
    there should be a pane next to this showing the rendered version of
    this `markdown` source.
2.  `IntelliJ` can export this document to another format using
    `Tools > Markdown Converter > Export Markdown File To...`
3.  Although you may edit this file for readability and accessibility,
    you will be working in different files in this project: **do not
    put your assignment work in this file**. Put your work in the
    appropriate files otherwise your work might not be reviewed.
4.  This readme file does not contain the instructions for
    Assignment&nbsp;2 Part&nbsp;1: instructions are provided separately
    from the `IntelliJ` project.
5.  **The first deadline** for this Assignment Part&nbsp;1 is
    submitting the online questionnaire saying who your tutor is and
    which challenge you have chosen. Once you have submitted the
    questionnaire you cannot change your challenge under any
    circumstances. Failure to submit the questionnaire could mean you
    do not receive any feedback which in turn will hurt your marks for
    Part&nbsp;2.
6.  **The second deadline** for this Assignment is submitting this
    version of your worksheet for feedback. Submission is via
    Gradescope after challenge choices have been processed. You will
    have a different `IntelliJ` project for Part&nbsp;2.
7.  Assignment&nbsp;2 Part&nbsp;1 is **formative** (for feedback but
    not graded) but it is still **compulsory**: failure to submit
    something meaningful for Assignment&nbsp;2 Part&nbsp;1 will harm
    your overall Assignment&nbsp;2 grade.
8.  Instructions for submitting Assignment&nbsp;2 Part&nbsp;1 are only
    on the Assessment part of the Learn website: this is so that there
    is a single, definitive set of instructions in case they need
    updating.
9.  The more familiar you are with the Java covered in the first four
    weeks, especially the first three weeks, the better: this includes
    lectures, reading (including the Code Quality document), labs, and
    tutorials.
10. It helps if you've done Tutorial&nbsp;3 so you are familiar with
    [markdown](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/markdown.html "markdown in IntelliJ")
    and
    [engineering requirements,](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119 "engineering requirements explained")
    both of which you need for Assignment&nbsp;2.
11. It also helps if you've done Tutorial&nbsp;1 which introduces
    informal pseudocode, which you might want to use in your
    assignment.
12. If you are a non-native speaker of English, do not spend too long
    interpreting the assignment instructions by translating: you need
    to learn to read longer texts quickly and unaided. You are at a
    suitable speed when you can read this assignment's documents in well
    under 2 hours, and can understand almost all the language without
    needing a dictionary. Do not worry about the occasional
    unrecognised phrase, nor if you are not yet fast enough: practice
    reading more widely; and practice reading more quickly.
