# Calculate My income Tax #

# Audience #
-This is for beginners using Java and beginners in Object Oriented programming or programming in general. They do not have much experience in programming and are looking for a very easy guide to follow. In addition, they are probably interested in finances or numbers in general thus 'Calculate my Income Tax' is perfect. They will learn about parsing, type casting, getting input from the terminal, outputting into the terminal and conditionals.

# Main justifications for choosing this challenge #
-This challenge uses a number of Java principles such as variables, casting, parsing, input and output from terminal and numbers. I found this challenge mildly challenging due to the number of cases that have to be addressed, especially when the personal allowance is reduced and what cases would apply.

# Confidence #
I have confidence in the challenge because of how clearly the instructions are laid out. It explains step by step how the income tax is obtained. It clearly states the 'income tax rules', which in itself are like guidelines for how to code this. There are also extensive test cases for each of the cases. There were multiple solutions each with extensive commenting and guidelines on what to do.

# Comparison of the winning design with the losing design #
The winning design was simple and easy to follow. It achieved calculating the income tax easily and accounted for each of the cases perfectly. It  also felt like it was more self-explanatory than the losing design due to the conditionals. The losing design used switch statements. These became quite long as in each statement came more switch statements for more cases. These became hard to follow and read even with comments and resulted in poor code quality.
